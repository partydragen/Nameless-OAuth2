# OAuth2 Module
The Nameless OAuth2 module enables your NamelessMC site to act as an OAuth2 provider, allowing secure authorization for applications to access user data without sharing credentials. It supports cross-linking NamelessMC sites, using client ID, client secret, and redirect URI for seamless integration.

## Installation
- Upload the contents of the **upload** directory straight into your NamelessMC installation's directory
- Activate the module in the StaffCP -> Modules tab
- You can now create OAuth2 Applications at StaffCP -> Applications

## How to cross link NamelessMC sites
1. Create a new application on Site 1 with can be the name of site 2 (Same on the other website)
2. Enable "Add integration & OAuth" setting on both websites
3. On site 2 go to StaffCP -> Configurations -> Registrations
4. There you will now see your Application in OAuth section, Enter your Client ID and Client Secret from Site 1
5. Copy the Redirect URI and enter that into the Application on site 1 in Redirect URI field
